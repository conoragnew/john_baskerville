        <h3>What established Paul Rand as the éminence grise of his profession?</h3>
        
        <blockquote>"Among these young Americans it seems to be that Paul Rand is one of the best and most capable [. . .] He is a painter, lecturer, industrial designer, [and] advertising artist who draws his knowledge and creativeness from the resources of this country. He is an idealist and a realist, using the language of the poet and business man. He thinks in terms of need and function. He is able to analyze his problems, but his fantasy is boundless."

<h1 id="Who?">Paul Rand</h1>

    <p><b>Peretz Rosenbaum</b>, or later known as Paul rand was hugely influential for redefining the visual culture in the US following the second world war and his work can still be massively influential and aspiring for young designers. Paul Rand is a major role model for graphic designers and artists and his principles of design were immensely credited by his peers. So much so that much of his work, mainly his corporate logos he created, are still acknowledged today by leading companies such as <i>IBM, ABC and UPS.</i> Although Paul was born and brought up in America, he was an original designer in that he embarked in the practice of the <b>Swiss style</b> in graphic design, but what exactly established Paul Rand as the <i>éminence grise</i> of design? And how did he get to the point of becoming one of the most well-known designers in the 20th century?</p>

<h1 id="Education">Early life and Education</h1>

    <p>Paul Rand was born in Brooklyn New York on August 15th, 1914. He was brought up into a Jewish family but always had an eye for design and paintings. Even though Paul would design signs for his father's grocery shop, his dad refused to believe that his hobby of art and design would make him a successful career. Paul was an incredibly well-educated designer whom attended the <b>Pratt institute</b> from 1929 to 1932, <b>the Parsons school of design</b> from 1932 to 1933 and <b>the arts student league</b> from 1933 to 1934. Although he studied at prestigious schools of art, Rand saw himself much as a self-taught designer with skills such as observation. He even goes on to say that, <blockquote>“I literally learned nothing at Pratt; or whatever little I learned, I learned by doing myself.” — from an interview with Paul Rand by Steven Heller in 1988.</blockquote>
    
    <p>Paul started off where every young designer begins, by building up a strong foundation of knowledge and strengths and bringing them together to create a substantial portfolio with their work and favorite pieces. At the beginning of his career, he also decided to change up his Jewish origin name from <i>Peretz Rosenbaum</i> to Paul Rand. He decided on the name with the mindset from a friend and himself that “Paul Rand, four letters here, four letters there, would create a nice symbol. So, he then became known as Paul Rand.” Roy R. Behrens stated the fact that:<blockquote>"Rand's new persona, which served as the brand name for his many accomplishments, was the first corporate identity he created, and it may also eventually prove to be the most enduring."</blockquote>

<h1 id="Career">His Career</h1>
    <img src="images/PaulRand%20direction.jpg" alt="Image of 'Direction'"/>

    <p>At the beginning of his lustrous career, he started off with minor projects but at the same time, was rapidly growing his reputation with his style of design. It didn’t stop in his early twenties however; his reputation was growing internationally, and his first major project came in 1936 when Rand was appointed as a free-lance designer for <i>‘Apparel arts’</i> which is now more commonly known as <i>‘GQ’</i> magazine. He originally began laying product spreads but wasn’t long before he advanced onto magazine covers. He impressed so greatly that Rand was offered a full-time job and the opportunity to take over the <b>Esquire-Coronet</b> magazines as the leading art director. At this time, Rand was still only in his early twenties and believed he was not prepared to take over such a role so originally declined the offer but a year past and he finally chose to take the part as leading art director at the early age of 23. Although most of his time was larger spent at the Esquire offices, he still took on creative freelance work on the side and designed <b>‘Directions’</b> which was a cultural magazine. Rand admitted In an interview by Steven Heller in 1990 that  “When I was doing the covers of Direction I was trying to compete with the <i>Bauhaus, Van Doesburg, Leger and Picasso.</i> Compete is not the right word, I was trying to do it in the spirit.”  — from an interview with Paul Rand by Steven Heller in 1990.</p>
    
    <p>Rand had already become a huge name in the design community, and it wasn’t until he became the chief art director in 1941 at the <b>Weintraub agency</b> when he really began to see his popularity grow. During that time, advertising hadn't changed much 50 years prior, but Rand wanted to change the perspective of advertising to include more of an art aspect and change up the responsibility of advertising from those who simply put no effort into the design to creative designers. Rand was different from a lot of other American designers as he relied heavily on inspiration from Europe such as Swiss Expressionist <i>Paul Klee.</i></p>

<h1 id="Corporate identity">Corporate Identity</h1>

    <p>Although Rand had a hugely successful start to his aspiring career, he is most commonly known for his corporate identities which are still influential and in use today. One of his key attributes, as <i>Moholy-Nagy</i> noted, was his persuasion as a salesman to explain the needs his identities would address for the corporation. According to graphic designer <i>Louis Danziger:</i> “He almost singlehandedly convinced business that design was an effective tool. [. . .] Anyone designing in the 1950s and 1960s owed much to Rand, who largely made it possible for us to work. He more than anyone else made the profession reputable. We went from being commercial artists to being graphic designers largely on his merits.”</p>
    
    <p>Rand designed some of the most memorable and visually pleasing logos throughout his career including logos for <i>IBM, Westinghouse, ABC, NeXT, UPS, and Enron.</i> The corporate identity business became one of the quickest growing graphic design sectors on the planet following the second world war. </p>
    
    <p>One of <i>Thomas Watson Jr’s</i> first tasks of the newly appointed manager of IBM was to find someone to redesign the famous IBM logo. Watson had hired <i>Elliot Noyes</i> who was a designer for the modern art museum who then in turn hired Rand for the job. Rands first design of the logo was simple but Rand being the perfectionist he was, he wasn’t happy, and it took years before he was satisfied with the final design. “I felt there was a problem with the sequence, going from narrow to wide without any pause, without any rhythmic possibility.” Finally, in 1972 Rand introduced a series of lines into the IBM logo to portray a well-rounded feel of unity.</p>
    
    <p>Rand faced a different challenge with UPS, instead of creating a design from scratch, he needed to transform the ancient logo into more of a modern design. He used a lower-case letter and added an image of a parcel above the shield. “I didn’t try anything else,” Rand admitted.  
    <blockquote>“If you show them more than two ideas” Rand would say, “you weaken your position. (...) You make one statement, and this is it”. — from an interview with Morris Wyszygorod, friend and associate of Rand by Steven Heller in 1997.</blockquote>
    
    <p>Although the public may view the logos as subtle and simplistic, Rand was quick to point out in A Designer's Art that "ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or exciting." 
    Without a doubt, his most notable piece was the NeXT logo that was collaborated with the infamous <b>Steve Jobs</b> when he was ousted from Apple. Rand's use of the simplistic but creative black box separates the NeXT logo into two different lines, which creates a more visual pleasing harmony that sold the design to Jobs. Steve Jobs was satisfied and just before Rand's death in 1996, he titled him "the greatest living graphic designer."</p>

    <p>Corporate design undoubtedly became the key aspect to his career and led the pathway for many designers to take inspiration from. Rand continued doing what he loved all the way up until his death in 1996 at the age of 82 when cancer took his life. From starting out as someone with a passion for art, painting and design to becoming one of the most influential designers in the world even to this day. Rand left a legacy behind for many young designers to match and follow. Proving his father wrong that something such as a hobby in art and design can path a way for a successful and happy career. As the saying goes, ‘do a job in which you love, and you'll never have to work a single day in your life.’</p>
